The aim of this project is to eradicate the sale and distribution of fake drugs using the power of the blockchain. Consumers that verify the legitimacy of the drugs they purchase get incentivised with the platform's governance token. Our goal is to prevent drug piracy by utilizing the blockchain to create a transparent and secure way to track drugs through the various steps of the supply chain.

Ndu is a decentralized platform for pharmaceutical companies to store serials and digital keys for each batch of their products on the blockchain.
It also allows for validating the authenticity of drugs and products purchased from pharmaceuticals around the world.

Our solution provides proper pharmaceutical inventory of drugs and medicines which is publicly accessible by users who can use such information to verify those in their possession. It equally enables these drugs to be tracked at each step of the supply chain which prevents used, tampered, and repackaged fake drugs from being delivered to users.

A licensed company subscribes with an ethereum account address and is given access to the features of the protocol

features include:
1. access to a decentralized database for  data storage
2. ability to store the hash of sensitive data on the blockchain
3. registered users will have the ability to put up proposals for voting by the community

**The Solution**

The end user(Consumer)

**Sign up**

The user should sign up after downloading the app for the first time. 

**Sign in**

The user should sign if they already have an existing account

**Overview of Dashboard**

When the user logs in, they get to see a simple overview of their activities on our platform which should a scan button(Emphasizing the main use of the app)

**Scan QR code**

Once the user scans a product, the see a screen that shows if the drug is registered or not 
Registered:  if the drug is registered then they get to see the product details and also a button to claim their token.

**Not registered:** 

If the drug is not registered then we can as well assume that the product is fake and provide the user with an option to report the product and be rewarded big time for saving more lives. We then forward the report to the appropriate authority to carry out an investigation.

**Report**

If after the investigation, the product happens to be fake, then we reward the consumer and also refund them their initial purchase price.
If a user raises a false alarm, for whatever reason, the user’s account will be disabled and we will let the law enforcement agency deal with such a user appropriately.

**Verifying report**

For transparency purpose and more data to help carry out appropriate investigation, we will request the user to send a snapshot of the product and the receipt of the product.


**Claim Token**

User can only claim report token(Huge token) after a report has been certified true.

**Notification(Consumer)**

Users should get notified about their token state and other activities on the platform.


**The Producer(Pharmacy)**

Sign up:
The Pharmaceutical company register’s through us by giving us their details and we verify by comparing their details with what the government provided us with and after that, we can  approve or decline your registration request.

Sign in:
If approved, you get to sign in with the company’s login details

**Overview of dashboard**

On signing in the company gets to see an overview of  their company’s activities on our platform.
Data capture
Just like the main aim of the user is to scan and verify pharmaceutical products, the main aim of the pharmaceutical company is to constantly update their data on our platform and they can do this by uploading details of all the commodities they produce.
Request code (Hash code)
For security reasons, these companies only get the actual QRcode on request and we believe that they only request when they are ready to print on their product package and this is what the proposed process is like:


1, Request for a number or QRcodes for a particular from your product line.

2, The hash decryption and QRcode generation happens on our servers and we only send the company the QRcodes and also let them know how important it is for them to keep it safe until packaging.


Decrypt Hash by entering your pin

On request of QRcode, we send the company an OTP just to authenticate the request.

**Company’s Dashboard**

Each company should have an elaborate dashboard about all their activities on our platform.

**Future feature**

In future, the entire data about the supply chain should be made open on blockchain for better traceability and transparency.
These companies can also choose to harvest their data for research purposes by paying us a token.


**The Government(Agency)**

Sign up:
Register as a government agency if it’s your first time.

Sign in:
Sign in if an account already exists.

**Overview of Dashboard**

See overview of all activities on the platform and the dashboard should be expandible. The government should also be able to see all the details of a specific company to enable them carry out proper taxing and other activities.

**Report**

They should be a section for them to see all the active reports
Notification

They should be notified about different activities on our platform.
